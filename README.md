I am part of the LANDSCAPYX SOFTWARE TEAM, and this project is not mine but their project, I am sharing this to get some help form experts. Please don't hesitate to help :D. You can also join our team, just go on their website: https://landscapyxsoftwareteam.wordpress.com. This project is a file and folder projector  : The user chooses a password and protects a file or folder.
